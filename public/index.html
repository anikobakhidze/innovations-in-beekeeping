An insoluble precipitate of a group of substances appears in the mixture, the amount and volume of which (obtained by self-precipitation) depends on the botanical origin of honey (5-10 ml). In the case of adulteration of the product, the amount of precipitation decreases or does not appear at all in the absence of honey in the product under study. The method is recommended for detecting gross adulteration (the content of the surrogate is 35 wt.% or more) in a large batch of honey"
