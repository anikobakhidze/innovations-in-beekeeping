      "paragraph": "Characteristics: absence of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and coloring agents detrimental to health, they are formed during acid hydrolysis of sugar when it is overheated. The method of obtaining the product involves the use of the enzyme invertase (sucrase, β-Fructofuranosidase) at a temperature of no more than 65 ± 2°C and its subsequent concentration to 81-82 wt.%..."

      "paragraph": " Characteristics: works to catalyze the cleavage of sucrose into simple sugars in an aqueous solution, without the formation of the harmful substance 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (unlike acid catalysts). Its activity is expressed in international units (IU), standardized with a filler (ground sugar), manufactured according to the standard of company # 212 00 269-002-2023 (“Demetra” LLC), sterilized to suppress the activity of microbial biomass used in catalysis, protected from oxidation by removing excess water during preparation, and storing it in a neutral gas (CO2) area."

An insoluble precipitate of a group of substances appears in the mixture, the amount and volume of which (obtained by self-precipitation) depends on the botanical origin of honey (5-10 ml). In the case of adulteration of the product, the amount of precipitation decreases or does not appear at all in the absence of honey in the product under study. The method is recommended for detecting gross adulteration (the content of the surrogate is 35 wt.% or more) in a large batch of honey"
